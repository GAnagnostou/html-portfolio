<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm born at 7th July 1983 in Athens Greece. At the age of 17 when i had to choose what i want to do in my life, 
  i knew that i want anything that has to do with computer science. But at these days the Universities were full of people 
  like me and the labor market was extremly small (aspecialy in Greece). So i deside to follow different path and since then 
  i work at many different jobs most dedicated to sales as a B2B Sales Representative and as a Concert Tour Manager to many Greek singers.</p>

<p>Now at the end of 2023 and at the age of 40, i decide to follow my dream and work on what i really love, so i choose Web Development.</p>
